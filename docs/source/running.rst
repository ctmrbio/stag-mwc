Running |full_name|
===================
You need to configure a workflow before you can run |full_name|. The code 
you downloaded in the previous ``git clone`` step includes a file called 
``config.yaml``, which is used to configure the workflow. 

Open ``config.yaml`` in your favorite editor and change the settings under the
``Run configuration`` heading: the input directory, the input filename pattern,
and the output directory, are the most important ones. They can be declared
using absolute or relative filenames (relative to the |full_name| repository
directory). Input and output directories can be located anywhere, i.e. their
locations are not restricted to the repository folder.

Next, configure the settings under the ``Pipeline steps included`` heading.
This is where you define what steps should be included in your workflow. Simply
assign ``True`` or ``False`` to the steps you want to include. Note that the
default configuration file already includes ``qc_reads`` and ``remove_human``.
These two steps are the primary read processing steps and most other steps
depends on human filtered reads (i.e. the output of the ``remove_human`` step).

.. note:: 

    You can create several copies of ``config.yaml``, named whatever you want,
    in order to manage several analysis from the same |full_name| directory.
    If you create a copy called e.g. ``microbime_analysis.yaml``, you can easily
    run the workflow with this configuration file by using the ``--configfile``
    commandline argument when running the workflow.

A reference database is required in order to run the ``remove_human`` step. If
you already have it downloaded somewhere, point |full_name| to the location
using the ``hg19_path`` parameter under the ``bbduk`` part of ``config.yaml``.
|full_name| can download and index the database for you, see `Downloading
databases` below. 


Downloading databases
*********************
Several of the tools used in |full_name| need special databases to work. Fortunately,
|full_name| makes it easy to download and prepare the required databases. The first
database you will need is the ``hg19`` reference database for use in the ``remove_human``
read processing step. If you do not have it available before using |full_name|, run
the following command to download and index the database for you::

    snakemake index_hg19

This will automatically download and index the BBMap masked hg19 file for you. The
database will be downloaded to the ``dbdir`` parameter specified in ``config.yaml``.
Note that creating the hg19 index requires at least 16GB of RAM, so it is typically
not recommended to do this on a laptop.

|full_name| can download several databases by typing ``snakemake <rule_name>``
using any of the following rules::

    build_metaphlan2_index
    create_megares_index
    download_centrifuge_database
    download_humann2_databases
    download_kaiju_database
    index_hg19  (already shown above) 

.. note::

    Make sure to update your ``config.yaml`` to reflect the location of the database(s)
    you have downloaded.


Running
*******
It is recommended to run Snakemake with the ``-n``/``--dryrun`` argument before
starting an analysis for real. Executing a dryrun will let Snakemake check that
all the requirements are available and it will then print a summary of what it
intends to do, without actually doing anything. After finishing the
configuration by editing ``config.yaml``, test your configuration with::

    snakemake --use-conda --dryrun

If you are satisfied with the workflow plan output by the dryrun, you can run
the workflow. The typical command to run |full_name| on your local computer
is::

    snakemake --use-conda --cores N

where ``N`` is the maximum number of cores you want to allow for the workflow.
Snakemake will automatically reduce the number of cores available to individual
steps to this limit.

.. note::

    If several people are running StaG-mwc on a shared server or on a shared
    file system, it can be useful to use the ``--conda-prefix`` parameter to
    use a common folder to store the conda environments created by StaG-mwc,
    so they can be re-used between different people or analyses. This reduces
    the risk of producing several copies of the same conda environment in
    different folders.

If you want to keep your customized ``config.yaml`` in a separate file, let's 
say ``my_config.yaml``, then you can run snakemake using that custom configuration 
file with the ``--configfile my_config.yaml`` command line argument.

Another useful command line argument to snakemake is ``--keep-going``. This will 
instruct snakemake to keep going even if a job should fail, e.g. maybe the
taxonomic profiling step will fail for a sample if the sample contains no assignable
reads after quality filtering (extreme example).


Running on cluster resources
****************************
In order to run |full_name| on a cluster, you need a special cluster
configuration file.  |full_name| ships with a pre-made configuration profile
for use on UPPMAX's Rackham cluster.  Find all available cluster configuration
profiles in the ``cluster_configs`` directory in the repository. The cluster
configuration profiles specify which cluster scheduler account to use (e.g.
Slurm project account), as well as the number of CPUs, time, and memory
requirements for each individual step. Snakemake uses this information when
submitting jobs to the cluster scheduler.

To run |full_name| on e.g. UPPMAX's Rackham, run the following command from
inside the workflow repository directory::

    snakemake --use-conda --profile cluster_configs/rackham 

This will make Snakemake submit each workflow step as a separate cluster job
using the CPU and time requirements specified in ``rackham.yaml`` inside the
Rackham profile folder. The above command assumes you are using the default
``config.yaml`` configuration file. If you are using a custom configuration
file, just add ``--configfile <name_of_your_config_file>`` to the command line.

.. note::

    Make sure you edit ``cluster_configs/rackham/rackham.yaml`` to specify
    the Slurm project name to use for Slurm job submissions.

Some very lightweight rules will run on the submitting node (typically directly
on the login node), but the number of concurrent local jobs is limited to 1 in
the default profiles.
